/*
 * The procedure for calculating the check digit, which may be carried out automatically in a
 * computer, is as follows:
 * 
 * 1. Take the first seven digits of the ISSN (the check digit is the eighth and last digit): 0
 * 3 1 7 8 4 7 2. Take the weighting factors associated with each digit : 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 3.
 * Multiply each digit in turn by its weighting factor: 0 21 6 35 32 12 14 4. Add these numbers
 * together: 0+21+6+35+32+12+14 = 120 5. Divide this sum by the modulus 11: 120:11 =10 remainder
 * 10 6. Substract the remainder from 11: 11-10 = 1 7. Add the remainder, which is the check
 * digit, to the extreme right (low order) position of the base number of the ISSN: 0317-8471
 * 
 * If the remainder is 10, substitute an upper case X in the check digit position. If there is
 * no remainder, put a zero in the check digit position.
